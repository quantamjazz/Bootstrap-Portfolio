# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is the second edition of my Portfolio as an aspiring Front-End Developer.

## Description

This project uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a responsive and visually appealing web page. The hero section features a full-width background image and centered text, while the navigation bar includes hover effects and active link highlighting. The Work section showcases projects using Bootstrap card carousel.

My portfolio includes a navbar which when clicked will scroll to the relevant section of the page which includes a large hero section (Home), a work section, an about/contact me section and a footer section which includes buttons to visit my linkedin and github profiles. This portfolio uses bootstrap and an external css stylesheet for design and is responsive on all screen sizes.
